To use place in garrysmod/garrysmod/lua/bin
(if the folder doesn't exist, make it you fucking retards)

Then in a lua file use the following code to add the function
require( "isdormant" )

Then on the entity of your choice call IsDormant on it like so.

entity:IsDormant()

It will return either true if it is or false otherwise.
